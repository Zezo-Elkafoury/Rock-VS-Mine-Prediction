# Sonar Data Classification Project

This project involves the classification of sonar data to distinguish between rocks and mines using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset used in this project is the "Sonar Data" dataset, which contains 208 instances and 60 features. The target variable is a binary classification indicating whether the object is a "Rock" or a "Mine".

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify sonar signals into two categories: **Rock** or **Mine**. The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and used to train a Logistic Regression model. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics.
